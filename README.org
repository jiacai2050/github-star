Oh My GitHub is a delightful, open source tool for managing your GitHub repositories/gists.

* Features
- Support local storage(SQLite)
- Rich search syntax
- Fast. Oh My GitHub's core is built in GNU99 C (tested with [[Https://valgrind.org/][Valgrind]]/[[https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html][ASAN]])

There are mainly two user interfaces:
- Emacs. Full-featured
  - Sync
  - Query repositories
    - Unstar
    - Query latest commits
    - Query latest releases
    - Download release asset files
  - Query created/starred gists

- CLI, TBD
  - Sync
  - Query repositories
* Emacs Interface
** Install
1. Download [[https://github.com/jiacai2050/oh-my-github/blob/master/emacs/oh-my-github.el][oh-my-github.el]]
2. Download required shared object, and rename it to =omg-dyn.so= or =dll= suffix if you are on Windows
   - From [[https://github.com/jiacai2050/github-star/releases][release page]] according to your operating system
   - or you can build it yourself with =make emacs-dyn=, be sure to install [[#Development][required dependencies]]
3. Put =el= and =so= files under =load-path=
4. Generate Github personal access tokens at https://github.com/settings/tokens and set it to =oh-my-github-pat=
5. Initialize with =oh-my-github-setup=

Here is a =use-package= config demo:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package oh-my-github
  :load-path "/path/to/oh-my-github/emacs"
  :config
  (setq oh-my-github-pat (getenv "GITHUB_TOKEN"))
  (oh-my-github-setup))
#+END_SRC

After setup, you can
- Check authentication with =oh-my-github-whoami=
- Sync repositories/gists with =oh-my-github-sync=
  - =~/.emacs.d/oh-my-github.db= is the default database file, users can customize it with =oh-my-github-db-file= variable.

** Usage
There are three major-modes for repositories:
- =oh-my-github-repos-mode=
- =oh-my-github-starred-repos-mode=
- =oh-my-github-trending-repos-mode=

And there are three derived modes for repositories:
- =oh-my-github-commits-mode=, commits of a repository
- =oh-my-github-releases-mode=, releases of a repository
- =oh-my-github-assets-mode=, asset files of a release

There are two major-modes for gists:
- =oh-my-github-gists-mode=
- =oh-my-github-starred-gists-mode=

The figure below shows relations among those mode:

*** Useful commands
- =oh-my-github-sync= Sync repositories/gists
  - +Emacs maybe hang a while depending on how many repositories you have.+
  - Since v0.4.0, synchronization happens in background thread, which will not hang Emacs any more. Users can check =*oh-my-github-log*= buffer for progress.
- =oh-my-github-list-created-repositories=
- =oh-my-github-list-starred-repositories=
- =oh-my-github-list-trending-repositories=
- =oh-my-github-list-created-gists=
- =oh-my-github-list-starred-gists=
- =oh-my-github-whoami=
